# 🧬 Cancer Analysis

This project explores potential causes of cancer using statistical methods and data visualization to identify whether any strong relationships exist between patient factors and cancer diagnoses.

---

## ✅ Project Status

**Completed**

---

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this project is to analyze a cancer dataset and investigate whether specific factors are more strongly associated with cancer incidence. The analysis focuses on identifying whether cancer is likely caused by a single factor or a combination of multiple contributing variables.

---

## 🔍 Methods Used

* Least Squares Regression
* Spearman Correlation
* Probability Mass Function (PMF)
* Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
* Data Visualization (scatter plots, distributions)

---

## 💻 Technologies

* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Pandas
* ThinkStats Library
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## 📄 Project Description

The dataset used for this project is sourced from **Kaggle** and is included in this repository. The analysis involved:

* Visualizing distributions of individual variables using PMFs and CDFs
* Measuring relationships through scatter plots and correlation coefficients
* Evaluating whether cancer is associated with one dominant factor or the interplay of multiple factors

The results suggest that **no single variable alone is a sufficient predictor of cancer**—instead, it's likely caused by a **combination of factors**.

## 📁 Getting Started

To explore or reproduce the project:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. The raw data is located in the `data/` directory.
3. All analysis is performed within the Jupyter notebook included in the repo.
